    <h2>You’ll Understand When You’re Older</h2>
    <p>
  Woo! <br>
  <br>
  Said I'd understand when I'm older<br>
  Said I'd understand the things they do<br>
  Falls asleep on their shoulder in the break room<br>
  She falls asleep on their shoulder in the break room<br>
  She said she'd been inside for too long<br>
  Well, no shit, could you tell us something new?<br>
  <b>You can tell he's lying cause his lips move<br>
  You can tell he's lying cause his lips move</b><br>
  It must be nice to be the reason<br>
  His work, it ain't so bleak<br>
  That must be what motivates you<br>
  That must be what motivates you<br>
  All he needs is to see you smiling<br>
  While you light up his whole week<br>
  Imagine the kind of things he'd do to you<br>
  If there weren't so many cameras<br>
  <b>And you're keeping a dark secret<br>
  But you're talking in your sleep</b><br>
  <br>
  Totally banned from the kitchen<br>
  Citing workplace health concerns<br>
  But they wouldn't tip you if it healed you<br>
  <b>No, they wouldn't tip you if it healed you</b><br>
  She says the country's sweating out a fever<br>
  A fever born by what you do<br>
  And what kind of pressure do they put on you?<br>
  What kind of pressure do they put on you?<br>
  <br>
  Well, at least she's waiting for you<br>
  Glass of wine after a long day<br>
  She'll dry your eyes on serviette<br>
  Dry your eyes on serviette<br>
  Fall asleep in her dad's Ford Mondeo<br>
  That she stole from him yesterday<br>
  You look so cute when you're so angry<br>
  <b>If I'm going down, you're coming with me</b><br>
  And you think that it gets better<br>
  Just you wait until next week<br>
  You're keeping a dark secret<br>
  But you're talking in your sleep<br>
  <br>
