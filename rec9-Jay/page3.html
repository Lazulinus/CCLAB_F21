    <h2>Concrete</h2>
    <p>
    One, two, one, two, three, four <br>
    <br>
    Any more words, I think you've spoke enough <br>
    'Cause the pubs are empty and they're closing up <br>
    When you're spitting spite as fast as saliva <br>
    But with the prose of a standard English drunk, she says <br>
    <b>"I hope the saltwater ruins your clothes <br>
    And I hope you spend the rest of your life sleeping alone <br>
    I hope the problems that make your life harder <br>
    Sit stubborn in your stomach like your kidney stones"</b>, and yet <br>
    <br>
    <b>All this over a kiss! </b><br>
    You weren't there, why you pressed by this? <br>
    Now it's turning three in the morning <br>
    The bouncer's put you on his third warning <br>
    But I'm still here, I'm not leaving! <br>
    <br>
    You won't get what you need (All this over a kiss!) <br>
    You know it's always the same, it's all just a game <br>
    If I had it my way, you'd sleep on the concrete <br>
    Floor, what'd you say to me? (All this over a kiss!) <br>
    'Cause I'm not sure <br>
    I'm not sure they'd let you off easily <br>
    <br>
    It's a pissed-off march up to bus stop station <br>
    With pissed-up eyes glossed with early conversations<br>
    <b>And the consequence of your desperation<br>
    Is the people on the nightbus have to listen to you!</b><br>
    And all I'm saying is (Woo!)<br>
    How can you look at yourself in the windowpane<br>
    Without wanting to hit yourself?<br>
    But your fist descends through the condensation<br>
    <br>
    All this over a kiss<br>
    You weren't there, so why you pressed by this?<br>
    Now it's turning three in the morning<br>
    The bouncer's put you on his third warning<br>
    But I'm still here, I'm not leaving<br>
    <br>
    You won't get what you need (All this over a kiss!)<br>
    You know it's always the same, it's all just a game<br>
    If I had it my way, you'd sleep on the concrete<br>
    Floor, what'd you say to me? (All this over a kiss!)<br>
    'Cause I'm not sure<br>
    I'm not sure they'd let you off easily<br>
    <br>
