    <h2>It’s All Futile! It’s All Pointless!</h2>
    <p>
  <b>I lost the passion that comes with living <br>
  Since I started university</b><br>
  I took a geography course to learn the datelines<br>
  And maybe use a sextant<br>
  But now I just press facsimiles<br>
  And you're exactly who you wanted to be<br>
  That's what you said<br>
  'Cause you wanna watch TV, and sleep all day, and lay in bed, but<br>
  You're forgetting that I've got to go to work and eat my food<br>
  And pay my rent, and reproduce, then feed those kids<br>
  And maybe use a sextant<br>
  <br>
  I don't miss you<br>
  I miss the thought of what we were<br>
  <br>
  'Cause this is the part where I shut up and let you infest my brain<br>
  Wrap your arms around my cortex, dig you in and let you drain<br>
  <b>You'll never get rid of me, oh, I'm like a fucking disease!<br>
  I'll make a home in your gut<br>
  'Cause it's somewhere warm to sleep</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>And what was your thought when you realized<br>
  You'll never feel naive love again?</b><br>
  Was it pain or was it sickness?<br>
  Were you proud of who you'd been?<br>
  The shyness waiting for his phone calls<br>
  Replaced by apathy and dating apps<br>
  You held his hands, it felt like flying<br>
  Now he's just another man<br>
  You'd rather he was inside than beside you<br>
  But he's talking marriage and a future<br>
  He's picking a lock he doesn't go into<br>
  <b>Less knife in a wound, he's a suture</b><br>
  <br>
  I don't miss you<br>
  I miss the thought of what we were<br>
  <br>
  'Cause this is the part where I shut up and let you infest my brain<br>
  Wrap your arms around my cortex, dig you in and let you drain<br>
  You'll never get rid of me, oh, I'm like a fucking disease!<br>
  I'll make a home in your gut<br>
  'Cause it's somewhere warm to sleep<br>
  <br>
  It's okay<br>
  Anything to make you feel less numb<br>
  It's okay<br>
  Anything to make you feel less numb<br>
  It's okay<br>
  Anything to make you feel less numb<br>
  It's okay<br>
  It's okay<br>
  <br>
  Eat my rent and eat my food<br>
  And eat my dues and eat those kids (It's okay!)<br>
  And maybe use a sextant<br>
  <br>
