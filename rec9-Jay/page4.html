    <h2>Perfume</h2>
    <p>
  It's 3:45 (AM!)<br>
  And I just bite my tongue<br>
  Update me on your life<br>
  And now you've found the one<br>
  But I don't like his eyes<br>
  And I distrust their name<br>
  And I hate their haircut<br>
  They look like a prick (A prick!)<br>
  But it's all the same<br>
  Would be daft of me to cry<br>
  Your tongue is razor sharp<br>
  I miss when it would fight mine<br>
  Left your heart on standby<br>
  By the way he holds you<br>
  Bet he serenades you<br>
  I can't really blame you<br>
  <br>
  And I can still smell her perfume<br>
  Did it rub off on you?<br>
  And I can still smell her perfume<br>
  Did it rub off on you?<br>
  <br>
  <b>You say your ex-boyfriend's a policeman<br>
  Well, I say you need better standards</b><br>
  You say your ex-boyfriend's a policeman<br>
  I say you need better standards<br>
  <br>
  <b>It seems like all her friends<br>
  Abruptly fell in love</b><br>
  And she was in the dust<br>
  Stalling; life was streaming past<br>
  So she learnt to lie<br>
  She learnt how to pretend<br>
  A drama in the futile<br>
  A means to an end<br>
  Why can't you be a dick?<br>
  Why must you be so nice?<br>
  <b>It's hard for me to move on<br>
  When I don't really hate you</b><br>
  (I don't really hate you)<br>
  (I don't really hate you)<br>
  (I don't really hate you)<br>
  <br>
  And I can still smell her perfume<br>
  Did it rub off on you?<br>
  And I can still smell her perfume<br>
  Did it rub off on you?<br>
  <br>
  It's 3:45<br>
  Your taxi's not arrived<br>
  I don't think that he's coming<br>
