    <h2> Oh Yeah, You Gonna Cry?</h2>
    <p>
    (Yeah, heh) <br>
    <br>
    <b>You got the same eyes as your father <br>
    And you carry the same kind of temper too </b><br>
    Oh, what a shame for the people of the community <br>
    Favourite thing's a fight and a lager <br>
    Name a better way to spin out a jar or two <br>
    He's a model citizen, through and through, you know <br>
    But I quite like your girlfriend! <br>
    How the fuck did she end up with you? <br>
    You know we talk about all the dumb shit you do <br>
    In the back room of the bar <br>
    In the backseat of my car <br>
    I'm the ending, she's the start <br>
    <br>
    Well, now, now, you need to calm down <br>
    What good's this energy? (Fuck you!) <br>
    When you devote it to me <br>
    Why not be a little more friendly? <br>
    Now, now, you need to calm down <br>
    <b>Does she still think of me? <br>
      Say my name in her sleep <br>
    I thought you knew her better than me?</b><br>
    <br>
    You don't give me that face <br>
    You know that the chase is through <br>
    And, well, she's still running away from you <br>
    You got the same eyes as your father <br>
    And you carry the same kind of temper too <br>
    You know, she told me that she fuckin' hates you <br>
    <br>
    Now, now, you need to calm down <br>
    What good's this energy? (Fuck you!) <br>
    When you devote it to me <br>
    Why not be a little more friendly? <br>
    Now, now, you need to calm down <br>
    Does she still think of me? <br>
    Say my name in her sleep <br>
    I thought you knew her better than me? <br>
    <br>
    Woo! <br>
    Yeah! <br>
    I thought you knew her better than me <br>
    (Woo!) <br>
    <br>
    Well now, now, you need to calm down <br>
    What good's this energy? <br>
    When you devote it to me <br>
    Why not be a little more friendly? <br>
    Now, now, you need to calm down <br>
    What good's this energy? (Fuck you!) <br>
    When you devote it to me <br>
    Why not be a little more friendly? <br>
    Now, now, you need to calm down <br>
    Does she still think of me? <br>
