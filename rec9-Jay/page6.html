    <h2>The Fall</h2>
    <p>
  Under the weight of a broken nose <br>
  It's not that simple, but he won't seem to notice<br>
  There must be more to this<br>
  So leave those sink estates, and let's book a holiday<br>
  We're painting all the counties in blue<br>
  'Cause we're already boring, and we're already hoarding<br>
  What else have we got left to accrue?<br>
  <br>
  And the ramblers will say<br>
  "It's got a marvelous view!"<br>
  <b>But they don't know how many lives it took, no<br>
  They'll never know what you knew</b><br>

  And we're so calm, but we're— (Fucking scared, fucking scared!)<br>
  And we're so calm, but we're— (Fucking scared, fucking scared!)<br>
  And we're so calm, but we're— (Fucking scared, fucking scared!)<br>
  And we're so calm, but we're fucking scared of people like you!<br>
  <br>
  Under the weight of some Sertraline<br>
  <b>A couple Prozacs, and now I'm pumping dopamine!</b><br>
  There must be more to this<br>
  We've got a country house now, old dog has been put down now<br>
  It's nice to be around trees<br>
  Custom license plate on our Audi R8 <br>
  How many grocers does one county need?<br>
  <br>
  And the ramblers will say<br>
  "It's still a marvelous view!"<br>
  But that treadmill still looms<br>
  With your hedonic misuse<br>
  <br>
  <b>So come on, one and all and see the apathy!<br>
  The reems of grey stencil that fills the tapestry<br>
  I look to all of you and see a different fucking species!<br>
  <br>
  Aspiration for a different destination to me<br>
  Across the Pennines, a thin blue line, a knife and a mall<br>
  I would do something if it wasn't all so effortful<br>
  'Cause I'm so high, my brain can't even look at the fall<br>
  And when you've reached the top, there's nowhere else to go but...</b><br>
